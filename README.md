# Final Project
## ECE 573/692 Neural Network
### Due data: 12/20/2018
### Objects: to design and develop a neural network utility (NNU) include backpropagation, SOM, SVM. 
#### Design specifications:
1.	The core of the project includes three algorithm:
    a.	Multiple layer of network using the back propagation.
    b.	Self-organizing map
    c.	Support vector machine
2.	The MATLAB GUI or C# or other forms of code can be used for the operation of the utility.
3.	Once a method is selected, different menus will be used for different algorithms. 
4.	The parameters can be entered from menus include  (not limited to) (depending on the algorithm):
    a.	For the backpropagation: 
        i.	Number of hidden layers
        ii.	Number of neurons on each layer include input layer and output layer
        iii.	Selection of the sigmoid functions or nonlinear function.
        iv.	others  
    b.	For SVM: Upper bound C, sigma for RBF, â€¦, and other parameters.
    c.	For the SOM: dimension of SOM, and others.
    d.	Input data file.
    e.	The data format: column or row.
    f.	Numbers of total data sample sets (or auto detection by your code).
    g.	The % of training, validation, and test; or the numbers of training, validation, and test.
    h.	Training stop criteria:
        i.	MSE
        ii.	% of error
        iii.	Number of epochs
5.	The output files of the training results, validation results, and test results for each input data set, excel file is preferred.
6.	Confusion tables of training results, validation results, and test results
7.	ROC of training results, validation results, and test result
8.	The NNU should be designed for general applications that should be applicable any dimension of input data.
9.	You can validate your NNU by using data of two-bit-Exclusive-OR (with additive noise) at four centers, two moon data having option of distance. Make sure that your code can deal with input elements more than two.
10.	Final Report is required at the time of submission. See the report template on D2L.
11.	Submit your code and final report via D2L submission box. If D2L is closed to you, email them to me.
12.	After your submit your code and report, please make an appointment to me so that you can demonstrate your project to me.  I will verify the functionality of your system with you. 
13.	The deadline is by the end of the second week of Spring semester; otherwise, discuss with me.
